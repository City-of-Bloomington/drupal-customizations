## Requirements
This module is written to work with v40 of the Animal Shelter Manager.  Shelter Manager's web services changed from v39 to v40.

## Installation
We recommend using composer for installing this module.  Right now, this module is still a sandbox project, so you will need to explicitly add this repository to your composer.json.

Main development for this module is on Github.  The Drupal.org repository is downstream from Github.
